    faqList:
      - question: "What image formats does /api/snap support?"
        answer: "You can generate screenshots in 'png', 'jpeg', or 'webp'. WebP is the default and offers fantastic compression and quality!"
      - question: "What about /api/carbon for code screenshots?"
        answer: "The carbon endpoint supports 'png' and 'jpeg' for creating beautiful code snapshots. WebP is not supported here, so it will fall back to PNG."
      - question: "What's the difference between sync and async requests?"
        answer: "Set 'sync: true' to wait for the job to complete and get the result in the same response. Use 'sync: false' (the default) to get a job ID immediately and fetch the result later. It's perfect for handling long-running tasks without blocking your app!"
      - question: "How do I get my access key?"
        answer: "Your access key is provided when you set up Snap Kit. Check out the ArcBlock documentation for more details on authentication and getting everything set up."
